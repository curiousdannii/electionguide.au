Dannii's Opinionated Guide to the 2022 Australian Federal Election
==================================================================

Welcome to my guide to the 2022 Australian Federal Election. This is opinionated in that the issues I cover are the ones that I personally think are most important, but I aim for my description of each party's policies within those categories to be factual. If you see an error, or something I missed, [let me know here](https://github.com/curiousdannii/electionguide.au/issues).

Remember, **you can't waste your vote in Australian elections!** Remember to number all candidates in the House of Representatives, and at least 6 above the line (or 12 below the line) in the Senate. You can safely give your first preference vote to a minor party and then vote for your preferred major party afterwards.
