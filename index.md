Dannii's Opinionated Guide to the 2025 Australian Federal Election
==================================================================

Welcome to my guide to the 2025 Australian Federal Election. This is as opinionated guide because it covers only the issues I personally think are most important, and I give my personal evaluation of each party's policies on these issue. Of course there are many other issues which other people care about, I just hope anyone who sees this might consider these issues as well when they decide to to vote for. But I do aim for my description of each party's policies within those categories to be factual. If you see an error, or something I missed, [let me know here](https://github.com/curiousdannii/electionguide.au/issues). I'm still adding the micro parties, there are a lot of them!

You might also like to use the ABC's [Vote Compass tool](https://www.abc.net.au/news/vote-compass).

Remember, **you can't waste your vote in Australian elections!** Remember to number all candidates in the House of Representatives, and at least 6 above the line (or 12 below the line) in the Senate. You can safely give your first preference vote to a minor party and then vote for your preferred major party afterwards.
